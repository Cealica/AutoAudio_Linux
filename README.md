# AutoAudio_Linux
A all in one script that will make any fresh installed distro into a audio production ready distro

(NOTE)
This script is still on the alpha stage so bugs will appear and hope you understand that this is the first time im coding on bash.

Things to reconsider.

1.The script is not yet final so expect some bugs
2.Submenu is still clunky (the 2nd option)
3.After Arch, i'll move to debian and ubuntu
